# mind-games-project
a humble attempt at game development

this repository is a unity game which is a collection of mini games.

two players are intended for this game, and the games intend to place players into
situations where games are won when a player predicts what the other player will do correctly.
Essentially, this game aims to create situations where players must think many steps ahead
as to what their opponents may do in order to pull an advantage.

many games will be available if this project continues, the first games to be implemented are:

bead game
spotter
elevator game
